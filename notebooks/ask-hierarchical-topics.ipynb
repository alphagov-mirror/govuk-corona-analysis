Can you clarify why these years are classed as ‘more important’ rather than a nursery? Due to us having children who are up to age 4, going into school can be a difficult transition. So I ask you these 2 questions: 1-are you able to clarify when nurseries will be returning, and what measures you will put in place- regarding to amount of children allowed within the setting. 2- why you are prioritising years reception to 6?</td>\n",

What happens when a child falls over and cries? The teacher won’t be able to pick them up and cuddle them? What if the children are holding hands skipping in the playground will they be told off ?

Why has it been decided that reception children are the priority children to go back first? 4/5 year old children will struggle with adhering to social distancing. At school we don’t have PPE or the luxury of space to ensure children and staff can adhere to social distancing rules. If reception, year 1 and year 6 come back along with key worker children that would be around 150 children. We are all being told we can’t see family members and yet there is potential for us to be in school with large numbers of children.   \n",
